      <description>Why am I doing this to myself? I really like taking notes. Notes are an extension of my stupid brain, which can&amp;rsquo;t remember a damn thing on its own. All these notes were being stored on Google&amp;rsquo;s servers, which didn&amp;amp;rsquo;t seem like the best idea. And it wasn&amp;rsquo;t just notes. Pictures, videos, miscellaneous files, I was giving it all to Google for free.
Since my notes contain my bad ideas, and they are my bad ideas alone, I wanted to take back control of my data.</description>
