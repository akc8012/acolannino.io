As you all know, it's apocalypse season. Now more than ever, in times like these, in uncertain times, and in hard times - We all need to come together and harass our elected officials.

The US response to COVID-19 has been an abject failure, at each and every level of government. This is not controversial or interesting or technical, so I'm not going to write further about it.

Instead, lets shift focus to Gina Raimondo, and how I've made it my quarantine mission to bother her. You see, Gina is the leader of the small state of Rhode Island. Rhode Island is significant for being one of the 50 states of the United States. It sure does exist.

Rhode Island is *particularly* interesting for my internet narrative because, for at least one point in time, it had [record low COVID numbers](https://www.nbc-2.com/story/42302778/connecticut-rhode-island-only-two-states-reporting-decline-in-new-covid19-cases), relative to the rest of the country. We had succeeded in flattening the curve.

Enter Gina Raimondo]. Gina saw these numbers, and thought they looked great. I agree Gina! Great numbers! Gina decided to get bold, and started to initiate **"Phase 3"** or whatever the hell. This phase can basically be translated into *"hooray, corona times are over! party time!!!!!* ðŸ¥³"

This is an obviously bad idea, especially with the rest of the country still floundering around in the COVID swamp like fools. Gina's actions and statements have been pretty frustrating to me, so I tried channeling that into something *"productive"*(?) with my [dumb web app](https://corona-gina.app/). It's an expression of my anger and bewilderment, and it was sorta fun to make. Let's talk about how I did it.

I encourage you to annoy her too. Please, actually, please do that. I think she is bad.
